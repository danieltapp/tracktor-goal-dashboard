# 🚜 Tracktor Goal Dashboard

This is a little dashboard I put together to visualize the data I'm farming via [Tracktor](https://github.com/danieltapp/tracktor)

## Potential Features (?)

- 📈 **Goal Tracking**: Keep an eye on your goals and watch them grow!
- 🗓️ **Deadline Reminders**: Never miss a deadline again (unless you want to 😉).
- 📊 **Progress Charts**: Visualize your progress with fancy charts and graphs.
- 🏆 **Achievements**: Celebrate your milestones with virtual confetti! 🎉

2. Navigate to the directory: `cd tracktor-goal-dashboard`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`

Happy goal tracking! 🚀
